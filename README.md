In this repository you are able to know the birthday's of three historical figures. When you run the program it will ask you what name do you want to enter. You can either enter the name of the three people listed or a different name. If you enter one of the three historical figure's name it will print out their birthday. If you don't put in one of the three names given then it won't print out a birth date and you will have to try again.
